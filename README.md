# Update Required ❤️

## Problem:
You’re upset.
And honestly… I understand why.

## Diagnosis:
Saturday night: Boys.
Communication: Inadequate.
Result: You feeling secondary.

## Correction Plan:
- Proper apology
- Full Sunday reservation
- Phone on silent (except for you)
- Priority: You > Everything

## Important:
Spending time with friends was fun.
But upsetting you wasn’t worth it.

## Final Note:

Spending time with friends was fun.
But upsetting you wasn’t worth it.

You matter more than one night out.

## Request:

Can we reset this?
Let’s not waste Sunday being distant.

Let me spend it with you properly.
No distractions. Just us.

Waiting for approval…

– Mukul
